"Number of Referrals","Avg Monthly GB Download","Total Refunds","Total Extra Data Charges","Total Long Distance Charges","Total Revenue"
# so we have 6 variables which has outliers
# we leave some binary variable because that is categorical variable and categorical variables has no outliers it's like 0's and 1's (Basically categories)

"Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, 
"occurs when customers stop doing business with a company or stop using a companyâ€™s services. 
"By being aware of and monitoring churn rate, companies are equipped to determine their customer retention success rates and identify strategies for improvement. 
"We will use a machine learning model to understand the precise customer behaviors and attributes., 
"Basically we are trying to find out the Customer churn pattern using K-Means clustering. 
"The primary objective is to identify Customer churn segments via K-Means clustering and design targeted marketing campaigns for each segment.

"In this K-Means clustering:-
"Customer Churn1 : 1st group (Highest number)
"Customer Churn2 : 3rd group (second Highest number)
"Customer Churn3 : 2nd group (third Highest number)
"Customer Churn4 : 0th group (fourth Highest number)

"6. Share the benefits/impact of the solution - how or in what way the business (client) gets benefit from the solution provided. "

"On the basis K-Means clustering We know more about Customer churn based on some varibales, 
"Basically we are trying to find out the Customer Churn using K-Means clustering. 
"The primary objective is to identify Customer Churn segments via K-Means clustering and design targeted marketing campaigns for each segment.
"so, because of K-Means clustering we can eassily figure out which group has the highest Customer Churn and which has lowest, and we can also see individual variables and know about Customer Churn"
